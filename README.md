# movie-recommendation-system

When the user searches for a movie, this model will recommend the top 10 similar movies using an item-based collaborative filtering algorithm. The dataset used in this demonstration is the [Movie Lens Samll Latest Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhammehta21/movie-lens-small-latest-dataset). I used the KNN algorithm to compute similarity with cosine distance metric which is very fast and more preferable than Pearson coefficient.
